# [AngularJS 2 Visual Studio 2015 Example](https://github.com/errisy/ng2ts)

AngularJS 2 beta has been published for quite a while. There is a [5 min quick start for TypeScript](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html). However, I could not find any example about how to get it work with Visual Studio 2015.

Therefore, in order to provide a starter example project to those who use Visual Studio 2015 to write Typescript for AngularJS 2, I made this example that get all TypeScript setting correct for AngularJs 2.

To download this project:
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/errisy/ng2ts  ng2ts
```

Then you just need to double click the 'ng2ts.vbproj' to open it with Visual Studio 2015. (You may need Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 or higher to support TypeScript 1.8).

Then it will work under either NodeJS lite or typical Apache-PHP setup.

To obtain all the files required for the original [AngularJS 2 exmaple](https://github.com/angular/quickstart/edit/master/README.md), you need to run

```bash
npm install
```
